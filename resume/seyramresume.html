        <div class="subtext" id="main">
            <p>As political refugees my family immigrated to the United States from Togo,
                West Africa in 2003. Our land was and still is wrought with war and fear
                of the government - which is why we had to flee our home. I was the second
                to last to be born into a family of 12 children and the first to go to college
                and graduate with a degree. From a young age, my mother instilled in me and my
                younger brother a hunger and ambition to seize every opportunity that crossed
                our path. The chance to attend college was made possible as a result of a soccer
                scholarship and assistance from my mother.  She supported me as we worked to pay
                for my books and the portion of the tuition that my scholarship didn't cover. She
                consoled me when I struggled to learn English as a 4th language. She emphasized
                relentlessly the importance of education. She is my inspiration and the primary
                reason why I pour my heart and soul into everything I do. </p>
            <p>I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life.Currently during my free time, if
                I'm not on the soccer field getting some exercise, you’ll find me in my makeshift
                lab researching, developing software, designing hardware, improving or creating new
                products and prototypes with my 3D printer. My hope is that someday my ideas will play a
                significant role in the progression of our technological evolution. Since the genesis of
                my journey with Apple two years ago I have also had success in inventing several products.
                Three of which are now under evaluation with Apple's legal team for patenting. I want to utilize
                my experience of coming to the US from Africa to positively influence, change and make the world
                around me even better. All my experiences give me a unique perspective which I channel into my
                work. Apple’s emphasis on collaboration, inclusion , and innovation makes it the best place for
                me to explore new ideas and nurture my creativity. This career experience will provide me the
                opportunity to grow and learn new skills which will take me to the next level in my current
                role as a Technical Expert and farther on.</p>
